OhMyDebn includes [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) by default. This includes a CLI version that runs in a terminal and GUI version that runs as an app.

`opencode-cli` runs in a terminal and automatically adapts to our [desktop themes](desktop-themes.md). You can start it by pressing `Super + A`.

The full app can be started from the [Cinnamon menu](cinnamon-menu.md) or the [Apps menu](apps-menu.md).

OpenCode is updated using our standard [update](updating.md) process so whenever you update OhMyDebn you will get the latest OpenCode version specified by that OhMyDebn release. OpenCode is evolving rapidly and updates are released on a daily basis. If there is a newer version of OpenCode that you would like to upgrade to, then you can use the `ohmydebn-update-opencode` command. You can either specify a version number or run the command with no arguments to automatically upgrade to the latest version.
