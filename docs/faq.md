## Why Debian?

Here are my requirements for a base OS:

- can run on bare metal and virtualized
- can be virtualized via Proxmox, Parallels, and other hypervisors
- must be supported by Parallels Tools
- must support x86 and ARM architectures

Debian satisfies these requirements and is well known for stability, simplicity, and versatility.

## Why Cinnamon desktop?

Here are my requirements for a desktop environment:

- must be available on my preferred base OS (Debian)
- able to support a traditional program menu
- able to support a traditional taskbar with the ability to re-arrange the order in which running programs are listed
- support hotkeys
- stable and reliable
- relatively light on resources
- must be responsive and not slow me down

Cinnamon satisfies these requirements and has some nice eye candy!

## Why Debian Cinnamon?

Why use Debian Cinnamon instead of Linux Mint or Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)? Linux Mint and LMDE are great, but there are a few reasons why you might want to use Debian 13 Cinnamon instead:

- Linux Mint is only available for x86 architecture. If you're on ARM, you need a distro compiled for ARM that can run Cinnamon (like Debian).
- Suppose you want to take a Debian 13 derivative (like Proxmox 9) and add the Cinnamon desktop. You can then use this repo to turn it into OhMyDebn!
- For fun and for science!
  

## What is the relationship between OhMyDebn and Security Onion?

OhMyDebn is not directly related to the [Security Onion](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion) project. OhMyDebn is sponsored by [Security Onion Solutions](https://securityonion.com) (SOS); however, SOS does not provide any technical support for it. OhMyDebn is intended to provide a general purpose desktop environment so, of course, you could use the included Chromium web browser to connect to your [Security Onion Console](https://docs.securityonion.net/en/2.4/soc.html)!
