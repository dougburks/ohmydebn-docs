## Neovim

To start a text editor, press `Super + N`. This launches the beautiful and powerful combination of Neovim with LazyVim. The first time it loads, it will install several plugins. Once that is done, you can press the `Q` key until you get to the main menu. You can then press the space bar and then the `E` key to open Explorer.

The [hotkeys](hotkeys.md) section includes more hotkeys for Neovim and a link to additional information.

## VSCode

You can also install VSCode from the OhMyDebn menu.
