There are multiple options for text editors depending on your needs.

## gedit

gedit is a very simple text editor with a graphical user interface. You can launch it from the app menu or by pressing Ctrl + Super + E.

## Neovim

Neovim is a powerful terminal-based text editor. To start it, press `Super + N` or type `nvim` at any terminal prompt. The first time it loads, it will install several plugins. Once that is done, you can press the `Q` key until you get to the main menu. You can then press the space bar and then the `E` key to open Explorer.
