Before updating, please review the [Release Notes](https://github.com/dougburks/ohmydebn/releases) so that you are aware of any changes.

Also make sure that you have stable power and Internet access to avoid any interruptions to the update process.

When you are ready to update, you can either open the [OhMyDebn menu](ohmyden-menu.md) and select Update - OhMydebn or open a [terminal](terminal.md) and run:
```bash
