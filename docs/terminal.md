You can start a terminal session from the [Cinnamon menu](cinnamon-menu.md), [Apps menu](apps-menu.md) or via [hotkey](hotkey.md) `Super + Enter`. This launches a beautiful and powerful [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org) terminal window that includes:

- Caskaydia Nerd Fonts
- [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) shell with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Starship](https://starship.rs/) shell prompt
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) for a smarter `cd` command
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) for beautiful directory listings via `ls` and `lt`

It also includes [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), which is a `cat` clone with syntax highlighting and git integration.
