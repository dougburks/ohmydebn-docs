## Web browser

To start a web browser, you can open it from the traditional program menu, from the Rofi application launcher, or just press `Super + B`. This launches [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) with the uBlock Origin Lite content blocker already installed for you.

If you prefer Google Chrome or Firefox, you can install them by going to [OhMyDebn Menu](#ohmydebn-menu) -> Install -> Browser.
