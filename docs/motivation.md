# Motivation

Growing up, my dad introduced me to computers through a [Timex Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair) and a [Magnavox Odyssey 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey_2). In 1984, I got a [Commodore 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_16) and, of course, the very first thing I typed was `PRINT "DOUG IS COOL"`. The first real program I wrote mapped the F1 key to do the same thing. So apparently I've been using the command line and hotkeys for (checks notes) over 40 years now!

Over the years, I transitioned from the Commodore 16 to the [Commodore 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128) and then into the PC world starting with an [Epson Apex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epson_Equity). I had several different PC systems running [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) and [Windows 3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1). In December of 1997, I discovered [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and my entire career changed. In 2008, I started the [Security Onion](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion) project to build a specialized Linux platform for cybersecurity. Security Onion is great for cybersecurity, but it's not designed to be a general purpose desktop environment.

Every year or so, I review my desktop environment to make sure I'm using the best tools for the job. Starting from [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle), I consider needs, desires, and workflows and ask myself a few questions: 

- What are the best of breed productivity apps that help me get my job done with a minimum amount of fuss? 
- What is the best terminal and command line environment?
- What is the Linux desktop environment that allows me to work with all of those applications at the same time most efficiently?
- How can I use hotkeys to keep hands on keys for better ergonomics and more speed?
- Which Linux distro provides all of the above and runs on the hardware that I need it to?

I've been inspired by [DHH](https://dhh.dk/) and his [Omakub](https://omakub.org/) and [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) setups to not only build my ideal desktop environment but publish it so that others can benefit as well. This is my own personal [omakase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omakase) menu, a curated collection of comprehensive components that balances the ideals of productivity, flexibility, and beauty while offering a modern command line experience and some fun 8-bit nostalgia as well.
