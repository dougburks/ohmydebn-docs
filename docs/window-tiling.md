## Basic Window Tiling

The Cinnamon desktop environment includes basic window tiling:

- Press `Super + Left` to make the active window tile to the left half of the screen.
- Press `Super + Right` to make the active window tile to the right half of the screen.
- Press `Super + Up` to make the active window tile to the top half of the screen.
- Press `Super + Down` to make the active window tile to the bottom half of the screen.
- You can tile to a corner by combining these options. For example, to tile to the upper right corner, hold the `Super` key and then press the Up arrow and then the Right arrow.
- Cinnamon's basic window tiling has no window gaps so it maximizes your screen area and is especially helpful when working on smaller screens like laptops.

## Advanced Window Tiling

For more advanced window tiling options, we've included a custom version of the gTile extension:

- Pressing `Ctrl-Shift-G` will display the gTile overlay and give you several options for tiling the active window.
- The default grid options are 2x2, 3x2, 4x4, or 6x6. You can select a different grid option with the mouse or by pressing `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`. You can modify these default grid options by going to the gTile extension settings.
- Select the starting tile by pressing the letter associated with that tile and then select the ending tile by pressing the letter associated with that tile. For example, to tile the window to the left half of the screen in a 4x4 grid, press `a` and then `n`.
- To set the window to a single tile, press the letter twice. For example, to tile to the upper left corner, press `a` twice.

There are also hotkeys for common tiling options that leverage gTile for window gaps:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + 1 (numeric keypad)` to tile to bottom left corner with gaps.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + 2 (numeric keypad)` or `Ctrl + Shift + Down` to tile to bottom half with gaps.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + 3 (numeric keypad)` to tile to bottom right corner with gaps.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + 4 (numeric keypad)` or `Ctrl + Shift + H` to tile to left half with gaps.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + 5 (numeric keypad)` or `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` to tile to full screen with gaps.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + 6 (numeric keypad)` or `Ctrl + Shift + L` to tile to right half with gaps.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + 7 (numeric keypad)` to tile to top left corner with gaps.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + 8 (numeric keypad)` or `Ctrl + Shift + Up` to tile to top half with gaps.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + 9 (numeric keypad)` to tile to top right corner with gaps.

For example, to lay out windows like in the following screenshot:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + O` to display the OhMyDebn logo and then `Ctrl + Shift 7` to tile to the upper left corner.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + S` to display the screenfetch window and then `Ctrl + Shift + 1` to tile to the lower left corner.
- Press `Super + T` to start btop and then `Ctrl + Shift + 9` to tile to the upper right corner.
