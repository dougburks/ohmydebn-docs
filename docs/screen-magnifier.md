## Enabling Screen Magnifier

If you need to zoom in on part of your screen, you can do so by enabling the magnifier via [OhMyDebn Menu](applications.md/#ohmydebn-menu). 

## Using Screen Magnifier

Once enabled, there are two different ways to magnify the screen:

- hold down the Alt key and then use your scroll wheel to zoom in and out
- if you prefer to use the keyboard, you can use `Super + Alt + Plus` to zoom in and `Super + Alt + Minus` to zoom out
